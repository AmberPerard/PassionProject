# PassionProject
A 3rd Year passion project for Devine for Myself

# My Core Project Statement: 
I started from my youth point with the Tamagotchi’s. I would try to recreate the looks and feel of a Tamagotchi game for the modern mobile context for Android and IOS with AR integration. This will be made with Unity. 

It will be made with Unity because Unity provide multi-platform support. So instead of working in a native AR platform, I would work with Unity and don’t have to worry about double writing the code.

So, I would like to research how the AR platform works and how to build a mobile game in Unity that works for Android and IOS. 

# Deliverables
* A demo of the Tamagotchi game
* IOS build of the game
* Android build of the game
